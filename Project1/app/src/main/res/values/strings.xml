    can be reused for events. Additionally input a time in the format of "hour:minute(AM/PM)-hour:
        minute(AM/PM)"with start and end times. An example is "5:00PM-7:00PM". Then, check the
    boxes where that event is. Finally, click submit to add to calendar. If an event is invalid, an
        error message will appear. An event is invalid if it overlaps with another time.</string>
